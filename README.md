# Data Analysis Project
# 911 Calls Capstone Project

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of 911 emergency call data to uncover patterns and trends related to the reasons for calls, timestamps, and call volumes. The goal was to gain insights into how emergency services are utilized and to identify peak times for different types of emergencies.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this analysis was to explore and visualize patterns in 911 call data based on:

**Reason for Call:** Categorized into EMS (Emergency Medical Services), Fire, and Traffic.\
**Time of Day:** Analyzed by hour to identify peak call times.\
**Day of the Week:** Examined to understand how call volumes vary across different days.

**Tech Stack:**

**Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Data Manipulation:**Used Pandas for data cleaning, restructuring, and aggregation.
**Visualization:** Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating heatmaps, clustermaps, and time series plots.

**Key Findings:**

**Peak Call Times:** The analysis revealed that peak times for 911 calls vary significantly depending on the reason for the call. For example, EMS calls tend to peak during certain hours of the day, while Traffic-related calls have different peak times.\
**Day of Week Trends:** Call volumes also varied by day of the week, with certain days experiencing higher volumes of specific types of calls.\
**Heatmap Insights:** Heatmaps and clustermaps provided a clear visual representation of how call volumes fluctuate throughout the week and across different hours.
